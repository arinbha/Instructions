They will help set up your intern project as well as host your evaluation meeting at the end of your internship. Within your first 1\u20132 weeks, you should schedule a dedicated 1:1 on a weekly basis. You should have a written agenda with the items that you wish to discuss and prepared questions to ask as needed. For a typical 1:1, we recommend the following structure: Progress Update: What have you worked on since your last meeting? Blockers: What are things that are currently blocking your progress? This should not just be a laundry list, but you should give concrete reasons why they are blocking your progrss and what you are actively doing to resolve them. Upcoming Plans: What do you plan on working on between now and your next meeting? Pro Tip: Ask for feedback proactively. It is highly important that you and your manager are synced on progress and perception of how your internship is going. Don't be afraid to ask for feedback proactively before formal evaluations. If your manager does give you something to improve on, asking beforehand gives you time to work on it and show coachability before the final evaluation. Working with Teammates + Asking for Help While most of your time will be spent working on your individual project, another goal of your internship is to learn more about how a software engineering team operates. Most Return Offers are for the same team that you interned on, so your teammates will also likely have a say in your evaluation. To that end, here a few ground rules for working with your team: DON'T SKIP MEETINGS: There will likely be many meetings where your team will discuss action items and projects to work on. As an intern, you most likely won't have much to contribute to these meetings since you are only there for a short time and aren't working on all parts of the team's system. That being said, that does not give you an excuse to skip these meetings. Be on time and don't be distracted. Ask Appropriate Questions: Even though you may not have much to personally contribute, you should still be an active listener and take interest in what the rest of the team is working on. Don't be afraid to ask questions to clarify concepts as long as you do so in a respectful manner. Take part in social events: Throughout your internship, you are a member of the team as well. To that end, you should aim to take part in team socials or other bonding events throughout the summer. Over the course of your project, you will also likely encounter moments where you are stuck and are unsure of how to proceed. While this is perfectly normal, the important thing is to get yourself stuck ASAP and not sit around twiddling your thumbs until someone notices and offers to help. Be proactive. When confronted with a problem, you should take the following steps to resolve it: Identify the Issue: What specific issue are you trying to solve? A common mistake interns make is the \"XY Problem\", where you focus on the problems with your attempted solution (X) rather than the root problem itself (Y). It's possible that your solution doesn't actually solve your problem, so articulate what the problem is first. Read Documentation: Before asking for help, you should read through the existing documentation and codebase to see if there are any notes about this problem previously. If there are internal message boards (such as StackOverflow), peruse those as well. Try Several Solutions: Think about some of the possible ways you can solve the problem, and write a rough prototype implementation. Even if these may not help the problem, doing this shows that you've given some thought and can help narrow down the specific issue.","title":"Navigating Office Relationships"},{"location":"03_navigating_office_relationships/#navigating-office-relationships","text":"","title":"Navigating Office Relationships"},{"location":"03_navigating_office_relationships/#11-with-manager","text":"Your manager is your primary go-to and most important stakeholder in your internship.

However, there are many tools at your disposal to get up-to-speed. In most companies, there will typically be a README or some other documentation guide explaining the structure and goals of the codebase. As an intern, one of your first jobs should be to sit down and read the entire documentation guide at least several times cover to cover and take detailed notes and questions about things you don't understand. Not only does this show that you are taking the job seriously, you will also gain insight into how corporate software works and learn how to structure your own codebases in the future. Another great practice when navigating a new codebase is to experiment with it yourself. As part of your onboarding setup, you should have created a local testing environment to simulate how consumers and/or internal users interact with your code. Pro Tip: As you experiment with the codebase to see how the different parts interact, write a document for yourself with short summaries explaining in your own words what the functions within the file are doing and how it contributes to the overall design. Git Most companies will have some sort of version control system for their codebase. Version control systems track and manage changes to code and files over time, allowing developers to revert to previous versions, collaborate simultaneously, and prevent conflicting edits. While each company and team will have different systems and practices, having a solid understanding of version control is important for success throughout your internship. We present Git as it is one of the easiest systems to become familiar with and is one of the most prevalent across enterprise codebases. Basic Commands git commit : Records a snapshot of your staged changes. When commiting, you should write a descriptive message detailing the changes made from the last commit git add LIST_OF_FILES : Makes your working changes in the files listed ready to commit git push : Uploads your local repository content to the other repository so others can view your changes git pull : Brings changes that were made from the remote repository into the local repository. Files are added to the commit, and their changes are recorded in a linear history. A typical workflow should typically contain the following steps: Pull changes with git pull Make local changes, committing periodically using git add and then git commit When satisfied, making them visible using git push Branching One of the core features of Git is that you can create separate independent paths to work on changes that are independent of one another. When working with a large codebase such as during an internship, it is recommended to create a separate branch for each independent feature that you are working on. Branches are created as history off the main branch for each individual feature. To create a new branch, use the following command: git checkout -b NAME_OF_BRANCH . This spawns a new branch from the commit point that you are already at, and then you can independently add new commits onto this branch without affecting the pre-exisiting branches. Rebasing As you work on several different branches, your coworkers will likely have also made changes to the codebase that you will need to design your code around. To avoid having problems where the status of your code differs significantly from the existing master branch, you should periodically refresh your branch with the latest changes from the master branch, which we call rebasing. Rebasing incorporates the commits that were pushed to the main branch since you created your feature branch by putting your commits on the top of the history. To rebase the master code onto your branch, use the following steps: git checkout -b NAME_OF_BRANCH_YOU_WANT_TO_REBASE_ON git pull master : This brings in any changes that were made by others onto your master branch git rebase master : This will update the status of your branch such that your changes will sit on top of the existing repository. Pull Requests and Code Reviews Once you are satisfied with the changes that you've made, you are ready to merge them into the main repository. However, in a corporate setting, you should NEVER attempt to push directly into master , as your changes need to be reviewed by someone on your team. Instead, you would create a pull request, signifying that your changes are ready for review to be merged into the master branch. Pull requests mark your work ready for review for other teammates to view. Depending on the scope of your changes, your reviewer may either approve the changes or leave comments and request a revision. It's completely normal for your changes to be rejected at the first pass, so don't obsess over writing completely perfect code. Often times, there may be an edge case that you hadn't considered or a different approach that might work better. Instead, you should focus on making sure that you understand the changes requested and make a note of them so that you don't repeat the mistakes in the future. Pro Tip: Keep a separate document to write down every major comment that you received in a code review and reference it periodically to ensure that you are following your team's best practices and avoid making the same mistakes repeatedly. AI Usage In the age of AI, many companies are increasingly encouraging developers to use AI for increasing productivity. While AI tools can be useful, one of the primary goals of an internship is to learn how to navigate a large codebase and tackle complex design challenges, so over-relying on AI will circumvent the learning process. IMPORTANT: Most open-source models, such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Google Gemini, should not be used for company work due to privacy regulations.

Depending on your manager, you may or may not be given the choice between several projects. In the first few weeks of your internship, you should schedule a meeting with your manager and/or mentor to go through your project specification and requirements. During this meeting, you should take the time to ask clarifying questions and work out an appropriate scope for completion as well as stretch goals. Your intern project is one of the primary factors that will go into your overall evaluation for a return offer, so it is critical that you align with your manager and mentor early on the expectations. Your project should be challenging enough that you are learning new technologies and solutions for tackling problems, but not so challenging as though you are overwhelemed with the project expectations. Throughout the course of your internship, you should schedule progress checkins on a weekly basis to troubleshoot sticky points and make updates to the timeline as needed. Design Document Before you start with the implementation, you should create a design document outlining the overall layout of your project. This typically will take the form of a design document, where you outine your problem statement and proposed implementation. Your design document should consist of the following sections: Problem Statement: Motivation for why you are even implementing this in the use case. What problem does the team currently have, and how does this project help solve this problem? High-Level Design: An overview as to how your solution will work and what it does. How does your solution address the problem above, and what ideas does it incorporate. Technical Design: The meat of your design document. Do a deep-dive into each specific component and explain the end-to-end design of each part (how are you fetching data, how do you render results, how does the user interact, etc.). The specifics of what questions you should address will vary depending on your specific project, but you want to give enough detail to explain how your system interacts so that other teammates will be able to understand and build on top of your work after your internship. Pro Tip: Use diagrams! They are a great way to show the end-to-end design and are more digestible than prose. We recommend using Lucid Charts to make your diagrams Alternative Designs & Pros + Cons: Often times, there is more than one solution to a problem, and you should consider multiple approaches and their tradeoffs before narrowing down to one final design. Briefly outline what altneratives you had and why they aren't as effective in your specific use cases. Appendices: Include data sources, graphs, and other information that is needed that you did not include in the above sections. You should aim to finish your design document draft before the halfway point of your internship. Once complete, you should schedule a meeting with your entire team to present your document. Often times, this is where you will get new suggestions or concerns that you may not have considered earlier and will need to incorporate in your final design, hence why we recommend getting your design document done early. Final Presentation Alongside your overall project, you will also likely have to give a final presentation documenting your work throughout your internship and outlining next steps. This is sort of a culmination of the work that you've done, and you'll likely be presenting this to other stakeholders and other people outside of your team. While presentations can be scary, the good news is that your design document already contains most of the information that you need! For your presentation, you should focus primariy on the following three things: Problem + Motivation: What problem are you trying to solve and why are you trying to solve it? High Level Design How does your solution address the problem? Use Cases + Extensions How can other people use your solution and build on top of it in the future? The goal of your presentation is more to give a pitch about your project and why it is worthwhile as opposed to a technical deep-dive. Most attendees will not be familiar with your exact team's tech stack and are more interested in the end-to-end process rather than the low-level system details. One again, START EARLY . While you already have a lot of the content prepared, there is still a lot of work to create and polish your presentation.
