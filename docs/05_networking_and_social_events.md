# Networking and Social Events

## Connecting with Other Interns

Interns are usually as lost as you, so it is a good way to form connections.

Some ways to connect with other interns are to:

- Join intern group chats (e.g. Slack channels, Discords, GroupMe, etc.)

- Go to intern events and start conversations, even if small

- If the company has intern lunches, go to them. You will get free food, and you get to socialize 
in an easygoing environment.

- Ask other interns what they’re working on for an easy communication starter

Other great ways to connect with other interns is to offer to get coffee or boba together, possibly after work.
You can also suggest exploring the city during the weekends.

## Connecting with People Outside of Your Team

A coffee chat is always a great way to meet people. It is a short conversation 
of 15 to 30 minutes in a easy and comfortable environment.
It is a great way to build connections. 
A great way to reach out is through Slack, and it has the added benefit of being a less serious
way to approach colleagues relative to email. Although email is still a good option if
that is your colleagues preferred way of communication.
Here is a sample Slack message template that you can use:

> Hi, [Name]! 

> I’m a summer intern on [Team]. I saw your work on [Project/Area] and it seems really interesting. If you have time, I’d love to set up a quick 15-minute chat to learn more about what you do.

> Best,

> [Your Name]

Most people will say yes, and, if they don't, the worst thing they can do is ignore you.
The benefits outweight the negatives.

## Exploring Your City

It doesn't matter if your intenrship is the same city you go to college, the same
city you've lived in your whole life, or an entirely new city, you should take time 
to explore it.

Some places you can explore are museums, coffee shops, restaurants, parks, free city events, 
and so much more.

If you are shy, you can always invite other interns along. 

It is important to make this experience the best it can be, and exploring the world
outside of your office and debugging is a great way to do so.
