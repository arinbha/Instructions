# Networking Beyond Your Team

## Connecting with Other Interns

Other interns are usually just as new and unsure as you are, which makes it a great opportunity
to form connections.

Here are some ways to connect with other interns:

- Join intern group chats (e.g. Slack channels, Discords, GroupMe, etc.)

- Go to intern events and start conversations, even if small

- If the company has intern lunches, go to them. You will get free food, and you get to socialize 
in an easygoing environment.

- Ask other interns what they’re working on for an easy communication starter

Other great ways to connect with other interns is to offer to get coffee or boba together, possibly after work.
You can also suggest exploring the city during the weekends. 

## Connecting with People Outside of Your Team

A coffee chat is always a great way to meet new people that you admire and want to learn from. 
It is a short conversation of 15 to 30 minutes in a easy and comfortable environment.
It is a great way to start and build connections. 
A great way to reach out is through Slack, and it has the added benefit of being a less serious
way to approach colleagues relative to email. Although email is still a good option if
that is your colleagues preferred way of communication.
Here is a sample Slack message template that you can use:

> Hi, [Name]! 

> I’m a summer intern on [Team]. I saw your work on [Project/Area] and it seems really interesting. If you have time, I’d love to set up a quick 15-minute chat to learn more about what you do.

> Best,

> [Your Name]

Most people will say yes, and, if they don't, the worst thing they can do is ignore you. The benefits outweight the negatives. You got this!

Here are some questions you can ask in a coffee chat:

- How did you get into this field?

- What does a typical week look like for you?

- What skills have helped you the most in your role?

- What advice would you give your intern self?

- How do you decide what to work on next?

Making connections is an important part of an internship. You can learn so much from listening to the experiences and knowledge of others. 

When you network, don't forget to meet people working in different fields: product managers, designers, data scientists, recruiters, program managers, and others. 
Understanding cross-functional roles, makes you a better professional in your intended career, broadens your career awareness, and makes future interviews easier by expanding your knowledge.

Meet people, make connections, and enjoy your internship!


## Exploring Your City

It doesn't matter if your internship is the same city you go to college, the same
city you've lived in your whole life, or an entirely new city, you should take time 
to explore it.

Some places you can explore are:

- Museums

- Coffee shops

- Restaurants

- Parks

- Free city events

- And so much more.

You can make goals, like try one new restaurant a week.

If you are shy, you can always invite other interns along. Chances are they are also
looking for something to do in their free time.

Internships aren't just about work. Taking the time to explore the world outside of the office 
(and outside of debugging) cultivates a more memorable and enjoyable summer.
