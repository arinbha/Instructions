# Networking and Social Events

## Connecting with Other Interns

Interns are usually as lost as you, so it is a good way to form connections.

Some ways to connect with other interns are to:

- Join intern group chats (e.g. Slack channels, Discords, GroupMe, etc.)

- Go to intern events and start conversations, even if small

- If the company has intern lunches, go to them. You will get free food, and you get to socialize 
in an easygoing environment.

- Ask other interns what they’re working on for an easy communication starter

## Connecting with People Outside of Your Team

A coffee chat is always a great way to meet people. It is a short conversation 
of 15 to 30 minutes in a easy and comfortable environment.
It is a great way to build connections.

## Exploring Your City

It doesn't matter if your intenrship is the same city you go to college, the same
city you've lived in your whole life, or an entirely new city, you should take time 
to explore it.
