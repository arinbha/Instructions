## Got the Offer… Now What?
Now that you have received your first job offer, it is time to think about what to do next. 

First, you must consider whether you want to accept the offer or not. To do this, we recommend
that you ask yourself a couple of questions: 

- How is company culture? Does the company culture align with your personal and professional values?

- Is the salary in line with market expectations for your internship role? Remember to consider role title, company size and location when researching market salary expectations.

Once you have answered those questions, you will have a better idea on whether you want to accept your
offer or not. If this is your only offer, you might choose to take it no matter your answers. It is still
useful to consider those details to have a better understanding of the company you will be working for.

## Housing and Commute

### Housing

When it comes to housing for an internship, the first thing to consider is whether
your internship offer includes housing or not.

If it does include housing, the company likely has more information on housing that 
you can request, and, then, you can plan accordingly.

If it doesn't, you must find it yourself. Following these steps, you should be able to
find adequate housing for your internship.

1. Communicate with the company's recruiting group and HR. They might be able to point
you towards resources or other interns who also need housing in case you need a roommate.

2. Look at nearby colleges and universities. Many of them offer summer housing for
internships. For example, Carnegie Mellon Univeristy offers Summer Intern Housing even if
you are not an enrolled CMU student. If you are a student at CMU, you can also apply 
for normal Summer Housing where you can room with other CMU students staying over the summer.
Different colleges have different dates where they have summer housing available, so
note those dates and find ones that more closely align with the dates of your internship.

3. A convenient way to find housing is Airbnb. There, you can select the exact dates
you need to rent for the period of your internship. Airbnb houses are usually furnished, which can be helpful when you are renting for a short while.

4. Another option is to look for a summer housing lease. This can be harder to find
as you are only renting for a specific amount of time.


### Commute

When selecting housing, it is important to consider your commute. It is good to know
how you plan to reach your work office and how long it will take you to reach it.
For the first day, it is always good to leave an extra buffer of time to arrive in 
case something unexpected occurs.
