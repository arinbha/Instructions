# Before You Start

## Got the Offer… Now What?
Now that you have received your first job offer, it is time to think about what to do next. 

First, you must consider whether you want to accept the offer or not. To do this, we recommend
that you ask yourself a couple of questions: 

- How is company culture? Does the company culture align with your personal and professional values?

- Is the salary in line with market expectations for your internship role? Remember to consider role title, company size and location when researching market salary expectations.

Once you have answered those questions, you will have a better idea on whether you want to accept your
offer or not. To choose between offers, the article <a href="https://joinhandshake.com/blog/students/how-to-decide-between-multiple-job-offers/">How to decide between multiple job offers</a> by Brinton Botkin might help you figure out the best choice for you.
Even if you only have one job offer, it is still useful to consider those details 
to have a better understanding of your role and the company you will be working for.

To accept the offer, you can email the hiring manager following this template:

> Hi [Name],

> Thank you again for the offer for the [Role] internship position at [Company]. I’m excited to accept the offer and look forward to joining the team this Summer.

> Please let me know if there are any next steps or documents I should complete before my start date.

> Best,

> [Your Name]

To reject the offer, you can email the hiring manager following this template:


> Hi [Name],

> Thank you again for offering me the [Role] internship position at [Company]. I truly appreciate the time you and the team spent speaking with me.

> After careful consideration, I’ve decided to pursue another opportunity and will not be able to accept the offer. I’m very grateful for the offer and hope our paths cross again in the future.

> Best regards,

> [Your Name]


## Outlining Goals

Before you arrive at your internship, it is useful to outline your goals to maximize
your professional growth and to ensure your experience aligns with your career aspirations.

Some possible categories of goals to set are the following:

- Technical goal (e.g. learning a certain tool or language)

- Career goal (e.g. deciding what you enjoy, like backend vs frontend)

- Networking goal (more details about networking can be found in Section 5: Networking and Social Events)

- Impact goal (e.g. make one contribution to an important product)

- Confidence goal (e.g. get comfortable with Github (more details about Github can be found in Section 4: Technical Background))

It is good to keep a running document of any task completed, bugs fixed, tools learned, metrics, and other similar details. 
This will be important for resume updates and final reviews throughout your internship and for your future.

## Team-Matching

Companies have different methods of assigning teams, so it is important to ask around. Some companies let you rank team preferences, which is useful to know if that is the case.

## Connecting with Manager

As you meet with your manager, it is important to set-up a comunication channel with your them. 
During your internship, they will be a very helpful resource if you need guidance.

When you have an offer from a manager, you can email them accepting the offer and introducing yourself.
You can also ask them for advice on what to review as well. 
A possible template for an email could the following:

> Hi [Manager],

> I’m really excited to join the team this summer as an intern. I wanted to reach out and introduce myself. 
Please let me know if there’s anything I should do or review before my first day.

> Looking forward to working with you,

> [Your Name]

## Housing and Commute

### Housing

When it comes to housing for an internship, the first thing to consider is whether
your internship offer includes housing or not.

If it does include housing, the company likely has more information on housing that 
you can request, and, then, you can plan accordingly.

If it doesn't, you must find it yourself. Following these steps, you should be able to
find adequate housing for your internship.

1. Communicate with the company's recruiting group and HR. They might be able to point
you towards resources or other interns who also need housing in case you need a roommate.

2. Look at nearby colleges and universities. Many of them offer summer housing for
internships. For example, Carnegie Mellon Univeristy offers Summer Intern Housing even if
you are not an enrolled CMU student. If you are a student at CMU, you can also apply 
for normal Summer Housing where you can room with other CMU students staying over the summer.
Different colleges have different dates where they have summer housing available, so
note those dates and find ones that more closely align with the dates of your internship.

3. A convenient way to find housing is Airbnb. There, you can select the exact dates
you need to rent for the period of your internship. Airbnb houses are usually furnished, 
which can be helpful when you are renting for a short while.

4. Another option is to look for a summer housing lease. This can be harder to find
as you are only renting for a specific amount of time.


### Commute

When selecting housing, it is important to consider your commute. It is good to know
how you plan to reach your work office and how long it will take you to reach it.
For the first day, it is always good to leave an extra buffer of time to arrive in 
case something unexpected occurs.
