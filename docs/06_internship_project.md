# Internship Project

## Project Overview
Typically, the bulk of your time during your internship will be spent
working on a project that will be integrated with the rest of the 
team's work. Depending on your manager, you may or may not 
be given the choice between several projects.

In the first few weeks of your internship, you should schedule 
a meeting with your manager and/or mentor to go through your
project specification and requirements. During this meeting,
you should take the time to ask clarifying questions and work
out an appropriate scope for completion as well as stretch goals.
Your intern project is one of the primary factors that will go into
your overall evaluation for a return offer, so it is *critical* that 
you align with your manager and mentor early on the expectations. Your project
should be challenging enough that you are learning new technologies and solutions
for tackling problems, but not so challenging as though you are overwhelemed with
the project expectations.

Throughout the course of your internship, you should schedule progress checkins on
a weekly or biweekly basis to troubleshoot sticky points and make updates to the 
timeline as needed.
